## Data

### Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from [Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)](https://www.bps.go.id/), the official Statistics Bureau of Indonesia. BPS provides comprehensive datasets on various aspects of Indonesian life, including agricultural production and demographic information.

### Data Analysis

To analyze the data obtained from BPS, a Jupyter Notebook is used. This Notebook contains detailed steps and methodologies applied to process, clean, and visualize the data, providing valuable insights into trends over the years.

#### Exploring the Notebook:

- **Access the Notebook**: The analysis can be viewed and interacted with through a Jupyter Notebook hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can access the Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qcFMjnyewvfr8yYx6XPBZpMkCFAOSY0X?usp=sharing).
  
- **Notebook Features**: The Notebook includes:
  - Data Cleaning: Steps to clean and structure the raw data from BPS.
  - Data Transformation: Procedures to transform the data into a more analysis-friendly format.
  - Visualization: Using various libraries to create meaningful and interpretable visualizations.
  - Insights: Observations and conclusions drawn from the data analysis.

#### Collaborating on the Notebook:

If you're interested in contributing to the data analysis or have suggestions for improvement, you can:
